# Animated City Scene

In this project I created a futuristic city scene that is animated. The shapes are a motorcycle, a spaceship, and a building. Then, following the same pattern as the snowman lab, I created lists then test functions to run the shapes. I also created two more shapes (alien and ground) to make my scene more complex. Once all of my shapes were drawn and scale correctly I created a scene.py file to draw my futurism inspired scene. In this file I imported the compound_shapes.py file and the graphics module so I could import my shapes. I created a main function where I could call and scale my shapes to where I wanted them. I did this by first creating a window and filling the background. Then I called the lists and made a for loop that draws the shapes in said list. I did this rather than calling the test functions directly because if I did the latter the shapes would not have drawn in the same window.
