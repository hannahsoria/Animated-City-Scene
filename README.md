# Animated City Scene

In this file I created three new compound shapes that I called init functions that scale and move as one object. These shapes are a motorcycle, a spaceship, and a building. Then, following the same pattern as the snowman lab, I created lists then test functions to run the shapes. I also created two more shapes (alien and ground) to make my scene more complex. Once all of my shapes were drawn and scale correctly I created a scene.py file to draw my futurism inspired scene. In this file I imported the compound_shapes.py file and the graphics module so I could import my shapes. I created a main function where I could call and scale my shapes to where I wanted them. I did this by first creating a window and filling the background. Then I called the lists and made a for loop that draws the shapes in said list. I did this rather than calling the test functions directly because if I did the latter the shapes would not have drawn in the same window. Once I was satisfied with the results I called the main function in my if name equals main and my futurism scene was displayed.
